# Mobile_Tab_Navigation Demo Project

• This project is just for the demonstration of my skills in HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
• Mobile navigation using HTML, CSS and JavaScript involves creating a responsive and user-friendly navigation system for mobile devices.
• This is typically achieved through the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript code to design and implement a menu interface that is optimized for smaller screens and touch-based interactions.
